ok this is my first ReadMe im doing so don't expect that mush anyways let's get started.

First things first im using the Minilibix Library developed by 42 Network.

this how i was using that graphical interface, for the first part all i what i did is putting images in the screen
with any map it should be dynamic that means any map was put in the .ber file exemple : 
map.ber
fd.ber
should be good but it need to follow some rule.

## Rules of the map
- needs to be triangle or rectangle.
- needs to be surrounded by walls.
- have at least 1 exit.
- have at least 1 collectible.
- have at least 1 Player.

that's for the things it should the map have if it's not that means there is Misconfiguration in the map.

The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: Player, Exit, Collectible, Wall, Empty Space.
